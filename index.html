    </div>
    <h6 class='font fontsm mb-5 text-center borderbs'>
This cell was supposed to be a representative democracy, where the people vote for our leaders, but ever since the President’s mutation scandal that has not been the case. A DNA replication is the permanent changing of the DNA sequence of a gene and as we all know performing a DNA mutation without congressional approval is an impeachable offense which makes this scandal much much worse. The congress people have divided into 2 factions (per usual) with one side defending the Presidents action and one side pushing for impeachment. The type of Mutation that the President has committed is called a “DNA INSERTION”. The experts have told us that this Mutation type can be used to add your own nucleotide to the strand. The experts have also confirmed that the President was tampering with the Election Strand, which is not surprising considering the President was behind  Mr. Cellmann by 15 points in the polls. We will update this story when there is more information

We just got word from the experts that the President has told the people of the cell that this was necessary considering the “state of this cell”. What do you think he means by that Tom? Well I think he is insulting the very things that make us citizens of this cell Jerald! Do you think this could have anything to do with the broken DNA strand that was recently discovered in the nucleus? No no, definitely not, he just hates all of us.

The experts here at The New Cell Times just got word from the experts in Washington that the root cause of the DNA mutation was definitely the President but in recently unclassified information it was discovered that the DNA was already damaged by a substance called mutagen. The question still persists though, who really caused the mutation and how will the DNA strand change?

  </div>
  <div  class="container">
    <h6 class='font  fontsm mb-5 text-center borderbs'>
Merry Christmas to all of you reading, but there is one person that is not having a very merry christmas, the President. He is currently in his first congressional impeachment in the house of representatives where they have brought up some very valid points. Firstly they obviously cited the 28th amendment to the constitution which states, “A citizen should, for no reason, deliberately attack, destroy, or seriously alter a DNA strand.” This amendment was obviously and the house has decided to impeach the president.

      The President was impeached for his crimes against the DNA at 10:46 am (03/15/21) and was promptly arrested. What he didn't know about was the small faction of senators that were plotting an assasination on the president. Let me break it down for you, right after the President was impeached there was a loud cheer from the crowd and the Senators which gave the Mr. Marcus Cellularius the perfect cover to sneak up behind the President and stab him in the back. He was then joined by a group of 10 other senators who stabbed him until he was dead.

          61 years after the Presidents impeachment the information has been unclassified. Heres what went down, First the DNA was damaged by the Presidentś chief of staff and that prompted the president to go investigate. When the President arrived at the DNA he realized what strand was damaged, the election strand. He then got his DNA specialist to develop a base that would fit perfectly in the spot of the damaged base. Then he took the specialist to the DNA and installed it. The DNA now has a completely different function than before, it would elect him for every election and effectively make the President dictator for life.  The districts congressman was interested in what the President was doing in the area and found the mutated DNA strand and promptly took all of the evidence to congress
